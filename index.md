      <hr />
      Elegant coding is as much art as it is science. The craftsman knows the
      right tool for the job, and favors pragmatism over dogmatism.

      <div class="author">~ Steve Jobs</div>
      <hr />
      Good design goes beyond aesthetics. User experience is how a person feels
      when interfacing with an application. UX includes such things as ease of use,
      perception of the value of the system, utility, efficiency in performing
      tasks and so forth.

      <span class="quote">
        Jason has been instrumental in the development of Lumentus Social. He helped
        lift the initial development from an ineffective team and put it on the right
        track. He has both recruited and managed the team to create our best-in-class
        application.
        <br /><br />
        He dedicated himself day and night to ensure its effective and reliable
        operation, and he successfully worked with internal management and external
        partners on all aspects of production.

        Jason brings to a project a killer combination of skills that imbues its
        team with a common language and purpose, allows the easy interchange of
        ideas, and keeps development bounding forward.
        <br /><br />
        He has a clear, open style of communication; a keen grasp of high-level
        business concerns; and a deep insight into technical complexities — that
        trifecta of traits that every project manager should have but so often does not.

        Jason impressed me during our collaboration on multiple projects. His
        Ruby on Rails development skills were apparent from day one. Most impressive,
        however, was his attention to detail and his ability to follow-up with
        even the most complex tasks. I could always count on Jason to reach out
        for help when he needed it or seek out answers himself instead of sending
        off an e-mail and waiting a day or two for the response.

        I had the pleasure of working with Jason for one-and-a-half years, he was
        the project's Technical Lead and hub of information for our team.
        <br /><br />
        As a software developer I was particularly impressed by Jason’s ability
        to take complex technical issues and communicate them succinctly and
        clearly to a room of non-technical staff.
